# Randomization Project
## Project objective
In this project I imagine a policy evaluation application and I compare two settings using Monte-Carlo simulations. The primary aim is to show that under randomization we can **accurately** assess the impact of a policy, specifically with no bias.

## Case study and Data
Suppose we want to evaluate the impact of a training program on the earnings of young individuals in a given country. 
We consider two possible settings:
1. auto-selection: young individuals choose whether they attend the training program or not
2. randomization: young individuals are randomly assigned to either join the program or not
   
For each scenario, we generate a dataset and we estimate the policy impact. We perform this multiple times and we compute the mean effect as the ultimate result for the given scenario. Finally we compare the final results obtained from the two scenarios and we draw our conclusions.

In this application, the variables are:
* wage
* treatment
* controls
*
